In the globalized world invasive species are a growing concern. Certain invasive species can lead to ecological damage and commercial losses and eventually health problem for humans and animals. The geographical nature of these phenomena advise the analysis, evaluation and visualization with geographic information system (GIS).

One invasive species which called attention in the last years is the Drosophila suzukii, commonly named the spotted wing drosophila. The vinegar fly was widely observed in parts of Japan,Korea and China. From there the fly was spreaded arround the world. In the last 10 years they could be observed in Swisserland and in South-West Germany (Rhine Vallay). In other parts of the world e.g. the United States this spread has also been observed.

Unlike other Drosophila, it infests non-rotting and healthy fruits and is therefore of concern to fruit growers, such as vintners. The main commercial inpact are on summer fruit including cherries, blueberries, grapes, nectarines, pears, plums, pluots, peaches, raspberries, and strawberries. In the United States the yield loss estimates widely vary and reached 80% loss in some areas and crops [^1].

For the control of pests it is necessary to combine different information sources in real time.The BIGGIS project adresses this challenge by:

1 Collecting data from several sources like the current distribution of the fly, wether conditions, elavation, landuse etc.

2 Data analysis of risk areas

3 Interactive visualisation of risk areas and infestion likelyhood

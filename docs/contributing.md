Git Commit Messages
===================

We follow the 'imperative present tense' style for commit messages.
(e.g. "Add new EnterpriseWidgetLoader instance")


Issue Tracking
==============

If you find a bug and would like to report it please create an issue
in github issue tracker for a particular sub-project.


Contributing documentation
==========================

BigGIS uses a [central documentation repository][docs-repo] where all the subprojects are documented together.
Additionaly, each sub-project contains basic information inside its `README.md` file.

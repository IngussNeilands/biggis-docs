# Contributing

We value all kinds of contributions from the community, not just actual
code. If you do like to contribute actual code in the form of bug fixes, new
features or other patches this page gives you more info on how to do it.

Git Branching Model
-------------------

The BigGIS team follows the standard practice of using the
``master`` branch as main integration branch.

Git Commit Messages
-------------------

We follow the 'imperative present tense' style for commit messages.
(e.g. "Add new EnterpriseWidgetLoader instance")

Issue Tracking
--------------

If you find a bug and would like to report it please go to the github
issue tracker of a given sub-project and file an issue.

Pull Requests
-------------

If you'd like to submit a code contribution please fork BigGIS and
send us pull request against the ``master`` branch. Like any other open
source project, we might ask you to go through some iterations of
discussion and refinement before merging.

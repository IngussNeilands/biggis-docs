# Land use data
    
## ATKIS/ALKIS 
The ATKIS/ALKIS Dataset is a mixure of official property data (ALKIS) on topographic basis (ATKIS) provided by State Agency for Spatial Information and Rural Development Baden-Württemberg. The dataset is the primary source for spatially explicit land use information in Baden-Württemberg and needs explicit authorisation before usage. The data was stored as shapefiles in a directory and ingested into Accumolo/Exasolution. 

ATKIS/ALKIS Data was used to analylize distribution of D. suzukii  ([Invasive Species Demo](http://biggis-project.eu/biggis-docs/demos/invasive-species/)) and to find training areas for the [Landuse Classification Demo](http://biggis-project.eu/biggis-docs/demos/landuse/)).

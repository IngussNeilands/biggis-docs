# Envirocar Dataset

The used dataset contains approximately around 1.7 million data points. Each data record contains 24 attributes
reflecting sensor values of the vehicle (e.g. speed, rpm, ...) as well as a CO2 estimation. Each data point is part of a
trip, which is described by a trajectory. While there are 5734 trips, a set of the trips' trajectories can furthermore
be associated with a sensor. There are 160 registered sensors which may be directly associated wit a vehicle. Additional
information about the vehicle (type, etc.) is provided as well.

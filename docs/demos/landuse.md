# Landuse classification

!!! TODO
    - Describe the idea
    - Maybe add some geotrellis examples

## Classification of Aerial Images according to Land Use Classes (using Land Cover Classes as intermediate)

## Tools
- Machine Learning
- Training: Multiclass SVM
- Geotrellis

## Example
- Classification of Aerial Images May-Aug 2016
- Layerstacking: Aerial Images + Satellite images (IR, Resolution 2m)
- Training of a Multiclass SVM with manually selected training data (classified image tiles)

## Further Steps
- Adding additional Layers, e.g.
- Terrain Height
- Homogeneity of Texture
- Using Other Classififiers

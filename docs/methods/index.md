# About Method

This section contains a **list of methods** that serve as a **theoretical background**
for the other sections inside the documentation, especially for the [Demos](../demos).

Some methods depend on each other which is reflected in their ordering.

## Methods to be included later

- Exasol: spatial indices
- Exasol: virtual schemas
- Exasol: language bindings (e.g. R)

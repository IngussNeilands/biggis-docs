# Digital ortho-images (Arial photographs)

Digital orthoimages were aquired across different flight campaigns between 2011 and 2015 building a mosaic that covers Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg entirely. The georeferenced images have a spatial resolution of 20cm and 4 spectral bands (blue, green, red, infra-red). The non-public dataset was provided by the State Institute for Environment of Baden-Wuerttemberg (LUBW) and State Agency for Spatial
Information and Rural Development Baden-Wuerttemberg.

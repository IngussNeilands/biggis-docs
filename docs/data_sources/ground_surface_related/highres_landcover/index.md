# Digital ortho-images (Arial photographs)

Digital ortho-images were aquired across different flight campaigns between 2011 and 2015 building a mosaic that covers
Baden-Württemberg entirely. The georeferenced images have a spatial resolution of 20cm and 4 spectral bands (blue,
green, red, infra-red). The non-public dataset was provided by the State Institute for Environment of Baden-Württemberg
(LUBW) and State Agency for Spatial Information and Rural Development Baden-Württemberg (LGL).

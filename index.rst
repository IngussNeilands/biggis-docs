About BigGIS?
=====================

BigGIS is a new generation of GIS that supports decision making in multiple
scenarios which require processing of large and heterogeneous data sets.

The novelty lies in an integrated analytical approach to spatio-temporal
data, that are unstructured and from unreliable sources. The system provides
predictive, prescriptive and visual tool integrated in a common analytical
pipeline.

The project is evaluated on three scenarios:
 - “Smart city”
 - “Environmental management”
 - “Disaster control”.


Please visit the `project site <http://biggis-project.eu>`__ for more
information as well as some interactive demos.
